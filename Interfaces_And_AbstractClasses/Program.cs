//Interfaces And Abstract Classes

/*
What is an Interface?
    - Contains a group of related functions that any class that implements the interface must implement.
    - Important because C# doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes.
    - Interfaces are a workaround for multiple inheritance.

* Think of an interface like a contract.
* Class agrees to implement all of the functions inside the interface.
* A class or struct can implement one or more interfaces.
